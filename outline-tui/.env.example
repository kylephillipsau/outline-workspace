# Outline OAuth2 Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your OAuth2 application credentials
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to your Outline instance settings: https://app.getoutline.com/settings/integrations
# 2. Create a new OAuth2 application with these settings:
#    - Name: outline-tui (or any name you prefer)
#    - Redirect URI: http://localhost:8080/callback  (MUST match exactly!)
#    - Scopes: read, write (or specific scopes you need)
# 3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret below

# Outline Instance URL (required for both OAuth2 and API access)
# For cloud: https://app.getoutline.com
# For self-hosted: https://your-outline-instance.com
OUTLINE_INSTANCE_URL=https://app.getoutline.com

# OAuth2 Client ID (required for OAuth2 authentication)
# Get this from your Outline OAuth application settings
OUTLINE_CLIENT_ID=

# OAuth2 Client Secret (required for OAuth2 authentication)
OUTLINE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# OAuth2 Redirect URL (MUST match exactly with your OAuth application settings!)
# IMPORTANT: This must be exactly "http://localhost:8080/callback" in both places:
#   1. In your OAuth app settings in Outline
#   2. In this .env file
# Default: http://localhost:8080/callback
# OUTLINE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8080/callback

# Advanced: Override OAuth URLs (usually not needed)
# These are automatically constructed from OUTLINE_INSTANCE_URL
# Only uncomment if you need non-standard OAuth endpoints
# OUTLINE_AUTH_URL=https://app.getoutline.com/oauth/authorize
# OUTLINE_TOKEN_URL=https://app.getoutline.com/oauth/token
